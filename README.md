# SQL-to-Power-BI-NBA-data-
Using the datasets provided by https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/szymonjwiak/nba-traditional/data?select=traditional.csv, I manipulate and analyse data in SQL, and load into Power BI to create a dashboard.

Szymon Jozwiak scraped data on all NBA (professional USA basketball) games from 1996-2023. We use his datasets, which are 1. the team's boxscore (how many points, assists, game was won etc.) 2. player boxscore (each individual players points scored, assists etc. within that game).
